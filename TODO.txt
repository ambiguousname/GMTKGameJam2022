- Firing at mouse is not exact (could be the cursor texture?)
- Make recoil much more apparent (move the gun back first, then the player?)
- Fix bug where ending dialogue by clicking fires bullets.
- Add drag + drop for multiple dice
- Add exit button
- Bullets don't go on top of tiles
- Dialogue is now skipping too much
- Add close button to die rolls
- Tie player movement into update? (Or accelerate). Slows down during combat.
