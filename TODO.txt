- Firing at mouse is not exact (could be the cursor texture?)
- Make recoil much more apparent (move the gun back first, then the player?)
- Add spread
- Player bullets shouldn't collide
- Start bullets with rb disabled initially (to prevent early collisions)? Would replace initial offset of spread.
